# Goals, Intentions, Guidelines

  - Environment for practicing Kent Beck style TDD [F.I.R.S.T. Unit Tests, fast builds, No Mocks, Hexagonal architecture]
  - Open source alternative to nCrunch
  - Eventually not just unit tests - but a collection of facilities that makes TDD a joy! e.g. TODO list, hotspot analysis, etc.


---
- TODO
  - [x] clone project
  - [x] CI [XXXXXX in readme.md]
  - [x] change files, ids
  - [x] convert to fable
  - [x] Loaded when enable tdd is hit
  - [x] test load in vscode -> works just like fake
  - [x] on enable, spawn tdds process
  - [x] enable, disable commands
  - [x] create sauve host for tddstud10 engine with getversion/time
  - [x] Test API using curl
  - [ ] rename + cleanup LanguageService 
  - [ ] while restapi, show spinner
  - [ ] publish as private beta?
  - [ ] on disable kill process
  - [ ] fillup readmd.md

- Later

  - [ ] fix icon
  - [ ] make enable/disable command contextual (i.e. enable should not be available when enabled)
